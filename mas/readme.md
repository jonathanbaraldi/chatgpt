Primeira interação

```sh
pip3 install matplotlib

python3 mas_demo.py
```




This demo initializes a 10x10 grid with three agents. Each agent moves randomly in the environment, and the environment is displayed using matplotlib after each update. The demo runs for 5 iterations, showing the movement of agents on the grid.

Feel free to adjust the number of agents, the size of the grid, or the number of iterations to better suit your presentation. You can also customize the agent's behavior and communication methods to demonstrate more advanced MAS concepts. Good luck with your presentation!
